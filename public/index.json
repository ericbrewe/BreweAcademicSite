First, thanks to Dali Ma and the Social Science Research Committee for supporting these workshops!\nThe Plan These three workshops are intended to get you thinking about Social Network Analysis, which has a number of theoretical and methodological committments that are different than doing standard inferential statistics. The workshops were reverse enginneered, the goal is to do SNA, and we will focus on analyzing networks, and analyzing individuals within networks. In order to do this we will learn some R, the schedule is below.\n    Topics Date    R for SNA 4 August 2020  Individuals within networks - centrality and hypothesis testing 11 August 2020  Properties of whole networks and network comparison 18 August 2020    What might you learn? There are lots of things that I hope you would learn: to look at the complexity of Social Networks, to use R tools to look at networks, to read code, to write code, to find that you are not afraid (and actually like) to analyze data with R. By the end of all three sessions here are things I think you should be able to do after participating in each of the workshops:\nWorkshop One\nWorkshop 1 Video\nWorshop 1 Slides\n Import Data into R Clean data and prepare data for SNA Organize data for SNA Vizualize data  Workshop Two\nWorkshop 2 Video\nWorkshop 2 Slides\n Understand different centrality metrics Plotting networks and incorporating centrality Test hypothesis using centrality metrics  Workshop Three\nWorkshop 3 Video\nWorkshop 3 Slides\n Understand different metrics about whole networks Compare networks on the basis of different networks   What is beyond the scope? While I would love to say you’d be able to master R in the short span of 3 weeks, you will not. I’ve spent a decade learning it and am proficient, but am constantly learning.\nSimilarly, R is a tool. You are the expert in your research, R can help you to uncover elements of your data. I don’t know how to analyze your data - learning R will empower you to analyze your data.\n  Why R? I began learning R because I wanted to have something that worked across different platforms. But then I realized that the Open Source movement was something that was particularly interesting to me. But those aren’t the reason. I have come to see R as crucial for reproducibility. If I write a set of code to analyze a dataset, I can re-run this code, and get the same results. I can share the code with my publications, so someone else can check my work. This is critical to doing science. R allows me to do this in a way that Excel doesn’t.\nCertainly other languages (Python, Julia, etc…) will also allow for this, but why I have stuck with R is that there is a rich community that are supportive of learning and growing.\nWhy Tidyverse? Open source things tend to be a bit tribal - within R one debate is Base R vs. Tidyverse. This is a debate about how to teach R, and I have decided to use the Tidyverse. It might not ever matter to you, but I want you to know that I have thought about this, and my answer is to use Tidyverse for the following reasons:\n Readability - Code should be readable by humans Coherence with my practice - I generally try to use the Tidyverse approach in my work, so I feel like I can best help by using these tools Coherence with themselves - These tools are organized in a way that helps them to be internally coherent Support - There are loads of books and websites that are published open-source, and so you can typically find the help you need.    Resources Leraning R is not easy, as I have learned things, I have tried to maintain a list of the different resources that I have drawn on.\nThe Basics\nInstall R and RStudio Introduction to R (using Base R) - R Programming for Data Science My all time favorite book for learning statistics and R is Learning Statistics with R Danielle Navarro also has a course Robust Tools that gives a sense about the breadth of the tools that R provides. These two guides, The R Guide and R for Beginners  A bit more advanced\nHadley Wickham’s book, R For Data Science Project Oriented Workflows WTF R Jenny Bryan is great at explaining things about R and so frequently, I find myself looking at her books. Cheat Sheets I can never remember all the commands. Data Transformation ggplot2 Regular Expressions  Happy Git With R Eventually you’ll need to use Git, and this is essential reading for making that transition. RMarkdown Markdown allows you to use reproducible code and integrate R into reporting and writing. This is how I do all my work. DataCarpentry runs workshops about data analysis and often are oriented to different research specialties.

All synchronous activities will be recorded and posted in a separate section.\n6 April - 12 June\nInstructors\n    email Office Hrs      Dr. Eric Brewe eb573@drexel.edu M 11-12; F 10-12 + By Appointment    Virgina Price vep32@drexel.edu Tu, Th, 1:00-2:00     Preamble This class is going to be weird, times are weird. I have taught blended courses, and used the tools available, but have not had any experience with fully online classes. I will be trying, I promise to be patient with you, and will ask the same of me.\nLearning Outcomes\n Apply key concepts and physical laws of magnetism and circuits including conservation of charge, Coulomb’s law, electric potential, Kirchoff’s rules, Biot-Savart law, Ampere\u0026rsquo;s law, Faraday’s law and Lenz’s law Analyze the dynamics of charged particles in magnetic fields Discuss sources of electric potential and analyze direct current circuits including steady state and time-varying conditions Develop critical thinking skills in the analysis of theory and applications in electricity and magnetism by problem solving and performing laboratory experiments  Textbook Matter and Interactions, Chabay and Sherwood\nCourse Tools Due to the transition to online learning, we will be using a variety of tools to support learning.\nZoom: We have a zoom classroom, you may need to install Zoom software. You should have received an invitation.\nGradescope: You will be handing in homework on Gradescope, you should have gotten an email from them about enrollment. We\u0026rsquo;ll talk about how this will work.\nSlack: We are going to have a Slack channel that people can use for varied classroom communications, you are not required to sign up, but, I\u0026rsquo;ve used it before, and students found it to be pretty useful.\nGlowScript: The class will be using GlowScript https://www.glowscript.org/ to develop small computational projects. GlowScript is not quite the same as vPython - but very clase, the TA, Virginia Price will be holding recitations on Wednesdays.\nCourse Outline We will aim to cover chapters 17-23 and one additional supplemental chapter S3 on Waves. Topics will include:\n Magnetic Fields Electric Circuits Magnetic Forces (including the Hall Effect) Patterns of EM fields (focusing on Gauss Law) Faraday\u0026rsquo;s Law Electromagnetic Radiation Waves and Particles  Grading I see grades as an indicator of your understanding, so your job in earning a grade is to demonstrate your understanding of course material. Because this course is using a different format, we are going to emphasize using problem solutions rather than exams as a way of demonstrating your competencies.\n   Category Percentage     Written Homework: 65%   Computational Homework: 25%   Class Participation: 10%    Homework Since homework is the primary way you will demonstrate understanding, you will need to write up homework in a way that demonstrates that you understand the material. You will need to not only show your work, but incorporate explanations of how and why you are doing what you are doing. In order to give you maximum opportunity to demonstrate your understanding, you will be allowed to re-submit your assignment for regrading. There are two types of homework, written assignments and computational assignments.\nWritten Assignments Homework will be submitted through Gradescope, and will be due on Monday nights at 11:59 PM.\nYou are allowed to work together on homework in the analysis phase, but you will need to work individually in the \u0026lsquo;writing it up\u0026rsquo; phase. This means while you may come to the same answers, your explanations of how you got there will be unique and distinct.\nThe goal of this class is that you master the content. We will grade each problem on each assignment with a four point rubric. If your score on any given problem is a 3 or 4, you will have completed the problem at a satisfactory level. If you do not score a 3 or a 4 you are welcome to resubmit. We will accept resubmissions each week on Monday nights.\nYour score on the written assignments will be the proportion of the problems that you have completed at the satisfactory level. So if you do all the problems, but only reach satisfactory on 85% of them, you will get an 85% for the homework score.\nGrading Rubric We will use the following rubric for all written assignments\n   Score Meaning     4 Fully complete, well explained, all work shown, correct answer someone could pick up this solution and read it.   3 Complete, explained adquately, work shown, correct answer. Someone would probably understand this solution.   2 Missing either adequate explanation or work, answer is correct, but someone would struggle to understand what you\u0026rsquo;ve done to get to this solution.   1 Missing either adequate explanation or work and answer is incorrect.   0 No or very little effort demonstrated    Programming Assignments Programming assignments will also be submitted through Gradescope. These assignments will be discussed in recitation, and will count as 25% of your overall grade. Programming assignments are due at the beginning of recitation on Wednesday in weeks 3, 5, 7, and 9 (see schedule below).\nClass Participation Much of this class will be active, we will expect you to be working together on problems, computational assignments, discussing, and asking questions. This will be worth 10% of your overall grade.\nGradebook I foolishly have written a gradebook app so you can see your current grade. To use it enter the randomly generated ID number I sent you. Gradebook Grades Grades for the course will be assigned according to the following scale:\n   Grade Percentage     A+ 97-100   A 90 - 96   B+ 87-89   B 80-86   C+ 77-79   C 70-76   D+ 67-69   D 60-66   F 0-59    Drexel University Resources: Note that Drexel University offers several resources to students in need. These include but are not limited to:\n   The Physics Help Center offers free tutoring sessions to Drexel students in introductory physics classes. It is not totally clear to me how this will work during Spring 2020.\n   Office of Disability Resources (ODR). Students with disabilities requesting accommodations and services at Drexel University need to present a current Accommodation Verification Letter (AVL) to the instructor before any accommodation can be made. AVLs are issued by ODR.\n  Health Center and Student Counseling: Please visit the following websites for specific information:\n http://drexel.edu/counselingandhealth/student-health-center/overview/ http://drexel.edu/counselingandhealth/counseling-center/overview/    Academic Integrity: Breaches of academic integrity, for example by cheating or plagiarizing, are serious infractions of the community standards of Drexel University.

One of the things that I had planned was to have individual meetings with my students. This is a luxury of having a smaller class.\nBasically, I built a week into the course schedule where I didn\u0026rsquo;t add any new material. I had no idea about how quickly or slowly the couse was going to go at the beginning. So I added a week of flex at the half way point. It was there to allow me to catch up if I needed to, to give students a week to catch their breath, and to assess how they are doing.\nThis was really smart\nSince my students are all physics majors, I found it weird that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t met many of them, and if they are going to be around for the next four years, I felt like I should have at least one conversation with them.\nI learned a bit about each of them, how they are handling quarantine, how they are adjusting to the pace and format of the class, and what they understood about the grades and grading system.\nSome of the things that I heard were that while the course was going ok, it also is a big difference for them. One student said, it is fine, but \u0026ldquo;I miss going to breakfast after class with the other students.\u0026rdquo; The need for connection was poigniant. A study of Drexel students revealed recently that students expect to pay substantially less for online classes. While this is problematic if you are a university administrator, the converse of this is that students value the interpersonal connection between student/faculty and student/student.\nOther things included that they weren\u0026rsquo;t looking at the gradebook (more on this later), and that they appreciated the opportunity to ask `little\u0026rsquo; questions (e.g. \u0026ldquo;How much explanation is enough?\u0026quot;, \u0026ldquo;How do I see the comments on the homework?\u0026quot;).\nFinally, I was able to encourage all of them to take the opportunity to resubmit homework for regrades. And as the week rolls on, I keep getting re-submissions.\nPlus it was a week away from grading, a week where I could catch my breath.\nSo on to the second half!\n","date":1588896000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588896000,"objectID":"ca65823314c9824af524586043e497e7","permalink":"https://ericbrewe.netlify.com/post/individualmeetingswithstudents/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/individualmeetingswithstudents/","section":"post","summary":"Since we've reached the halfway point in the quarter, I thought it wise to check in with the students","tags":null,"title":"Individual Meetings With Students","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["PHYS 115"],"content":" My teaching agenda includes weekly problem solving workshops. The idea is that students should have time to work together on solving some problems. It has taken three different flavors thus far.\nStudents have a question about the homework problem that is due on Mondays. If someone asks, we will work on the problem in small groups and then come back together. Students all work on a problem that illustrates something that I want to emphasize. This is good practice when I want students to have a common starting point for more complex problems or when I want to emphasize different approaches to solving a single problem. Students are in groups and each group is assigned a different problem. This works well when they are not struggling with the problems, and I want them to have the opportunity to see lots of different problems.  So how to make this work at a distance?\nFirst, I use Google Jamboard, because I can set up a separate board for each group before class, with a unique url. In the jamboard, I include the problem that I want them to work on, either as a link, or a picture, or today I used a sticky note. One of the things that I have to remember is to set the sharing options so that anyone with the link can edit (otherwise no one can write on the jamboard).\nOnce I have set up the jamboards, I find it important to keep a google doc that has the links for each group and the group number, so I can quickly share these.\nIn Zoom, I have people join breakout rooms (3-4 per room). Then I cycle through the rooms and using the chat function assign each room a problem (that is why having the links handy is useful).\nToday, I managed to put all four jamboards on my extra monitor, so I could keep track of how groups were making progress. It was so cool!🎉👏👍 I felt like I was in some sort of problem solving command center. I was able to see groups making progress, I didn’t have to move from Zoom breakout rooms to pose questions (in one group I asked a question by adding a sticky note), and then I noticed another group didn’t seem to be making much progress so I joined that breakout room and was able to help out a bit.\nI love having students work problems out together because I think it does a ton of good.

The basic theory of this practice is that we should be assessing students on their understanding, so this means that they have to demonstrate said understanding. They do this in my class by submitting weekly homework (not a big deal). The big difference in standards-based grading is that each problem is evaluated on a standardized rubric.\nI need a rubric. But I also know that websites like Chegg make it super easy to find answers to textbook problems. So a rubric that just evaluates answers may not ensure that students are demonstrating understanding. The rubric I have developed then focuses on explanation of their solutions. It is here:\n    Score Meaning    4 Fully complete, well explained, all work shown, correct answer someone could pick up this solution and read it.  3 Complete, explained adquately, work shown, correct answer. Someone would probably understand this solution.  2 Missing either adequate explanation or work, answer is correct, but someone would struggle to understand what you’ve done to get to this solution.  1 Missing either adequate explanation or work and answer is incorrect.  0 No or very little effort demonstrated    Then the students’ grades are determined based on the proportion of the problems that are evaluated as satisfactory. So for example, if a student submits 100% of the problems, but only 85% are evaluated as satisfactory, then that student would have an 85%. Another student who submits only 80% of the problems but every problem submitted is evaluated as satisfactory would get an 80%.\nThis grading scheme is interesting becasue it is not what physics majors have typically experienced. They are used to solving problems and focusing on right answers. It is possible for a student to have correctly solved every problem, but have not explained anything (meaning no words), and that student will have a 0%! One of the biggest challenges I have is helping students to break this habit of submitting solutions without any explanation.\nThat is not the end though. Because the goal is for students to achieve standards, I also allow for students to resubmit work (up to 9 times). This helps to alleviate the issue of students who have solved problems correctly, but haven’t explained. Go back, explain, and resubmit. You can take a 0% to a 100% fairly efficiently. Hopefully, it encourages students to review their feedback and consider the work they have submitted - at least that is the ideal. Currently, it feels like about 1/3 of the class is fully on board - including explanations and writing up work thoroughly and many times beautifully. One third has not used a single word in any of their problems - so we talked aobut this in class today. And the middle third hasn’t quite calibrated their explanations, sometimes they are doing it effectively and sometimes not.\nThis process is interesting, I am testing it at a small scale (16 students). I am evaluating relatively harshly in the beginning as I find that if I don’t they won’t come to the realization that they need to incorporate explanations. Gradescope makes this process pretty easy as I built the rubric one time and use it over and over for each problem. But that is a different post.\n","date":1587513600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586964563,"objectID":"53e05872c9c422580611abbb2c37d690","permalink":"https://ericbrewe.netlify.com/post/standards-based-grading/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/standards-based-grading/","section":"post","summary":"My plan for this course has been to use standards based grading on weekly assignments.

So I wrote about SBG in a separate post Standards Based Grading.\nThe theory is good, but implementing it means I need to be able to accomplish a few things:\nI need a gradebook that calculates the proportion of problems that are satisfactory. I need a gradebook that students can check online. I need to be able to revise these grades as students resubmit. I need to be able to accept resubmissions.  First, and foremost, Gradescope is pretty well set up to collect electronic homework and to allow you to grade homework electronically. For this part, you write up a homework pdf, create a homework assignment, select your grading preferences (I choose positive scoring, with 0-4 as the possible score for each problem), set some due dates, and add a rubric.\nI wrote one rubric, that I apply to each problem:\n    Score Meaning    4 Fully complete, well explained, all work shown, correct answer someone could pick up this solution and read it.  3 Complete, explained adquately, work shown, correct answer. Someone would probably understand this solution.  2 Missing either adequate explanation or work, answer is correct, but someone would struggle to understand what you’ve done to get to this solution.  1 Missing either adequate explanation or work and answer is incorrect.  0 No or very little effort demonstrated    Grading on Gradescope is somewhat faster than by hand, as I can read a problem solution and just push a button and it will assign that score. You can also annotate solutions.\nSo collecting homework isn’t a problem. The problem arose when I needed to be able to collect resubmissions. This isn’t built easily into Gradescope, though when I emailed them they came back with four suggestions quickly, Nice Work Olga! To handle resubmissions, I set each homework to allow for late submissions and set the due date on late submissions to the end of the grading period. That way students can upload as many times as they need.\nI graded my first assignment, and then realized that BlackBoard (our content management system) and Gradescope don’t easily allow you to maintain a gradebook that looks at proportion of problems above a certain score. I know R, why not just build my own gradebook. So that is what I have done.\nGradescope allows you to download a csv file that includes a Student ID, their scores on individual problems and their email. There is a bunch we can work with. But there is a problem, I can’t post grades based on any of those things, and BlackBoard does not do grades based on a proportion.\nFirst, I assigned each student a randomly generated number and added it to the gradebook\nID_Postable = sample(1000:9999, nrow(gradebook), replace = F) gradebook %\u0026gt;% mutate(ID_Post = ID_Postable) -\u0026gt; gradebook  But there is a problem. Grading systems all calculate based on percent scores so a student with all 2s would get a 50%. I need a grading system. I have a gradebook, but need to calculate the proportion of problem scores that are evaluated as satisfactory. The work flow is Pull in weekly grades, clean up the column names, calculate a weekly proportion of satisfactory problems, then add this to the total.\nFirst, I wrote a function to clean up the names of the weekly grades and to limit what we included.\nCleanAndNameFunction = function(df,Ch){ df \u0026lt;- df %\u0026gt;% select(-c(Name, Email, `Total Score`, Status, `Submission ID`, `Submission Time`, `Lateness (H:M:S)`, `View Count`) ) df %\u0026gt;% select(-SID) %\u0026gt;% names(.) %\u0026gt;% str_extract_all(\u0026quot;: [PQ0-9]+\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% str_extract_all(\u0026quot;[PQ0-9]+\u0026quot;) -\u0026gt; ProbNames ProbNames = unlist(ProbNames) #Assign names of Problems names(df)[2:length(df)] = ProbNames #Adds the Chapter Number to each of the problem column names df \u0026lt;- df %\u0026gt;% rename_at(vars(ProbNames), function(x) paste0(\u0026quot;Ch\u0026quot;, Chapter, x)) df } Now I have to calculate the proportion of the problems in any given week that are satisfactory (in my case, this means a score above 2). R and the Tidyverse are good, but really focus on analysis by columns, doing this was surprisingly more difficult than I had thought. So I wrote a function that identifies all the data, then it evaluates each column as to whether it is above the cutoff score, but that evaluates to TRUE/FALSE, so that has to be converted to numeric and rowSums (the dplyr version) was calculated. Then I renamed to ChapterNGood (the number that are satisfactory), ChapterNPoss (the number of problems), and the ChapterGoodPercent (satisfactory / possible).\nPercentAbove = function(df, Ch){ Chap = paste0(\u0026quot;Ch\u0026quot;,Ch) df %\u0026gt;% select(starts_with(Chap)) %\u0026gt;% mutate_all(function(x) as.numeric(x\u0026gt;2)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(NGood = rowSums(.)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(PercentGood = 100*NGood/(length(.)-1)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(Poss = length(.)-2) %\u0026gt;% select(NGood, Poss, PercentGood) %\u0026gt;% rename_at(vars(NGood, Poss, PercentGood), function(x) paste0(Chap, x)) %\u0026gt;% bind_cols(df) %\u0026gt;% select(SID,everything()) } Hooray! But now we need to blend these data back into the gradebook and calculate the overall proportion of scores that are satisfactory.\nI don’t yet have this as a function, because it will certainly use a quosure…but this does it for two chapters…\nOverallScores \u0026lt;- gradebook %\u0026gt;% select(SID, ID_Post, contains(\u0026quot;Poss\u0026quot;), contains(\u0026quot;Good\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% select(SID, ID_Post, contains(\u0026quot;Ch18\u0026quot;), contains(\u0026quot;Ch19\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(OverallPercent = (Ch18PercentGood*Ch18Poss + Ch19PercentGood*Ch19Poss)/(Ch18Poss + Ch19Poss))  Yes! It works. Now I just need to figure out how to post these so they can be published anonymously and accessible electronically. This means Shiny 😬!

Furthermore, it identified structural sex differences in the interplay of values among these matters that can affect individual and community views toward domestic violence. Drawing from survey data gathered from 265 young adult Indian men and women, this study used network analysis to graph a correlation network of beliefs and attitudes toward domestic violence. Node, scale, and network structure descriptions allowed for comparisons among male and female participant responses. The findings support the assertion that there are sex differences among the system of beliefs toward wife beating among Indian young adults. Gender ideology, masculine role in relationships, and legal and social consequences of wife beating emerged as the most important values to focus on when addressing young men’s beliefs of domestic violence and attitudes toward women. In contrast, values influencing women’s perceptions of domestic violence are more complex and related to multiple beliefs about women’s power, family structure, and social and legal implications of domestic violence. The results highlight the importance of recognizing gender differences in the connectivity between gender and wife beating beliefs when designing interventions. There is a need for efforts to accurately target these values and attitudes to more effectively address gendered attitudes and beliefs about domestic violence in this population.","tags":["Network Analysis"],"title":"A Network Analysis of Domestic Violence Beliefs Among Young Adults in India","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jessica E.

We examined brain function in 107 undergraduate students during a task known to be challenging for many students – physics problem solving – to characterize underlying neural mechanisms and determine how these support comprehension and proficiency. Further, we applied module analysis to response distributions, defining groups of students who answered using similar physics conceptions, and probed for brain differences linked with different conceptual approaches. We found integrated executive, attentional, visual motion, and default mode brain systems cooperate to achieve sequential and sustained physics-related cognition. While accuracy alone did not predict brain function, dissociable brain patterns were observed when students solved problems using different physics conceptions, and increased success was linked to conceptual coherence. Our analyses demonstrate that episodic associations and control processes operate in tandem to support physics reasoning, offering potential insight to support student learning.","tags":[],"title":"Brain activity links performance in science reasoning with conceptual approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric Brewe"],"categories":null,"content":"So, now I\u0026rsquo;ve done it. I have taught a week online. I had a day of logistics and getting to know (even though I don\u0026rsquo;t see people\u0026rsquo;s faces) the students on Monday. That did nothing to prepare me for the trainwreck that was going to be my first day of lecturing.\nI learned a ton about what I do when I lecture today. My approach to lecture is the sort of standard \u0026ldquo;Chalk and Talk\u0026rdquo; sort of thing. I do not typically prepare a bunch of slides (or any actually). Typically I talk, write on the whiteboard and periodically pause to ask questions that I expect the students to answer verbally (e.g. \u0026ldquo;If the current here is 10, what would the current be over here?\u0026quot;). I also do not write out a script - I have an outline, and tend to work from the outline which allows me to improvise as I went along. So I assumed that is what I would do.\nMy plan has assumptions built into it.\n I assumed I would be able to use \u0026lt;Bitpaper.io\u0026gt; to make sketches and do the \u0026ldquo;Chalk\u0026rdquo; part, while I talked. I assumed I would be able to ask questions of the students and get answers. I assumed my outline was about 50 minutes (gulp, not the case.)  Shit started unravelling for me beginning about 30 min before lecture.\n Thirty min prior to lecture: Bitpaper only allows you one whiteboard / month for free, which I had not discovered because I only tried one at a time. So at the last minute I had to change to using Google\u0026rsquo;s Jamboard. Two min into lecture: I realized about 2 minutes in that my students all have their video off, so I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see their faces to see if they were understanding anything. They are also all muted so if I ask questions, they all answer using chat. This is ok, but I need to think through how to adapt my current style to this situation Five min into lecture My pen has this annoying feature, where it stopped working consistently and I had to keep switching back and forth between the pen and laser feature. Twenty five min into lecture I was both underprepared and overly optimistic. I need to have a much more detailed outline than I did today. I need to build in some time to have students have the opportunity to ask questions. I got through what I needed, but felt like I was both adding details that don\u0026rsquo;t need to be there and skipping over things. Twenty six min into lecture I forgot to start recording the lecture. We are supposed to record all the synchronous class meetings, and I forgot, so my recording starts 26 min into class. Fourty five min into lecture I use a lot of gestures while I am teaching. This does not translate at all to the chalk and talk setup I have here. I truly don\u0026rsquo;t know what I can do about this, but be aware. Twenty five min after lecture I have to do this again next week.  Nothing to do but get better, becasue that was about as bad as it gets.\n","date":1555459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555459200,"objectID":"9d3cec0b14401b753f36cbdc19ce6163","permalink":"https://ericbrewe.netlify.com/post/coursereplanningincrisis/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/coursereplanningincrisis/","section":"post","summary":"After week one of teaching things change.","tags":null,"title":"Adapting Plans","type":"post"},{"authors":["Eric Brewe"],"categories":null,"content":"Drexel is on the quarter system. And because students could not stay in dorms safely, Drexel announced that all classes during the spring quarter would be fully online.\nI have never taught a fully online course. I have never taught a course during a pandemic. I have never taught the course I was planning before (PHYS 115, Contemporary Physics III).\nThe announcment that all courses would be fully online was made right before final exams, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t even get to practice with one class online during Winter Term. I did get to practice with giving an online final exam through BlackBoard - but that is a different story. What I did learn was that I did not want to give online exams.\nBackground The class I am teaching is the third course in a three course sequence for physics majors. It uses Matter and Interactions, and I am in charge of content starting with magnetism. There are not quite 20 students in the class. It typically meets three times a week with a two hour long recitation/lab that has students engage in computational projects using vPython. I am teaching this class because the person that typically teaches it is on sabbatical, so there is an existing syllabus.\nAlso, I have the priveledge of having a stable family, good internet, a new computer, and two weeks of spring break (not spring break) to plan. So here is what I have come up with.\nStarting with a survey Since I had no idea what they wanted out of this, I decided to first survey the students. Where would they be (14/16 in Eastern Time Zone), what would their internet access be like (most fast, but not all), did they prefer graded or ungraded (pretty even split), synchronous/asynchronous/mixed (this was a mixed bag), and what are their concerns.\nCourse Design As Rachel Scherr said, \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t sign up for this. They did not sign up for this.\u0026rdquo; Everything is a set of decisions, and here are the decisions I decicded to make.\nSynchronous/Asynchronous? The responses about this were pretty mixed, with some strongly requesting synchronous. My students will all be in North America, and the provost strongly suggested doing synchronous. So I decided a mix, with the week effectively starting on Wednesdays:\nWednesday - Synchronous - Introducing new material\nFriday - Asynchronous - Conceptual development activitie\nMonday - Synchronous - Problem Solving workshop\nGraded or Pass/Fail? Students were pretty split on this, so I went with graded, based on the assessment system that I am working out.\nAssessments I will set up a series of homework assignments (6-10 problems/week) that need to be written up with explanations. They will submit assignments each Monday, each problem will be graded with a rubric, and each week they can re-submit problems that they want to improve upon. The class is small, so I can do this - not sure how this scales to much larger classes.\nComputational assignments, they will have four computational assignments. They are going to do these in GlowScript, which is pretty similar to vPython and should run on everyone\u0026rsquo;s laptops.\nParticipation, I am going to ask that people are engaged - by synchronously participating, by doing activities, or if they can not attend synchronously by watching the videos that we make in class.\nCheck-ins. I think it is going to be important to check in with students about half way through the quarter, so I built in one week with just one:one meetings.\nFinals. We are not going to have one. I see no reason to have one. I would rather have students do some sort of presentation (their favorite problem of the quarter?) But we won\u0026rsquo;t have a final.\nTools With this, I need to have a set of tools that I am going to use and some that I have the students use. Here are the tools I am going with and why.\nSynchronous Meetings We have Zoom, we\u0026rsquo;ll be using it.\nVirtual Whiteboard While I present material, I want to be able to write on a whiteboard, so I have decided to use Bitpaper \u0026lt;bitpaper.io\u0026gt;, I can write on my Google Chromebook and have Zoom display what I am writing. Initially I thought students might work together on their own whiteboards, but I am concerned about requiring that. I might try it depending on how things go. I considered Google Jamboard, but like the display of bitpaper a bit better (particularly the eraser).\nOnline Computation This class uses vPython. I do not. So evaluating tools such as trinket https://trinket.io/, jupyter notebooks, google collaboratory, or GlowScript was a challenge. The first two use vPython from emacs (I say as if I know what I am talking about). But basically, the students all said GlowScript was the best option. The projects will have to be adapted, but hopefully I can have some serious help on that front.\nClassroom Communication When I have taught online before with classes that have a coding component, I found having a Slack for the classroom to be pretty useful. Plus it lets them coordinate times to talk about howework etc. They were into setting up a Discord server. But I am older so Slack it will be.\nHomework I learned about Gradescope https://www.gradescope.com/ and wanted to give it a try anyway. But it seems to do all the things I want / need to be able to do and maybe will do it faster. Since we have a rubric that we will use for all assignments, it should be pretty useful. Plus it allows multiple resubmissions and re-grades.\nWith these decisions out of the way I can actually start planning what we are going to do!\n","date":1555459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555459200,"objectID":"4ccdeccc057e291f7148d24681441bf3","permalink":"https://ericbrewe.netlify.com/post/courseplanningincrisis/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/courseplanningincrisis/","section":"post","summary":"Adapting to fully online teaching.","tags":null,"title":"Course Planning during Covid","type":"post"},{"authors":["Eric Brewe"],"categories":null,"content":"I had a bad day on Wednesday, class was clunky, my technology kept freezing, and I felt bad about myself.\nSo today when 4 different students showed up for office hours I was a bit nervous.

Published by the American Physical Society. Although active learning is supported by strong evidence of efficacy in undergraduate science instruction, institutions of higher education have yet to embrace comprehensive change. Costs of transforming instruction are regularly cited as a key factor in not adopting active-learning instructional practices. Some cite that alternative methods to stadium-style, lecture-based education are not financially viable to an academic department. This paper examines that argument by presenting an ingredients approach to estimating costs of two instructional methods used in introductory university physics courses at a large public U.S. university. We use a metric common in educational economics, cost effectiveness (CE), which is the total cost per student passing the class. We then compare the CE of traditional, passive-learning lecture courses to those of a well-studied, active-learning curriculum (Modeling Instruction) as a way of evaluating the claim that active learning is cost prohibitive. Our findings are that the Modeling Instruction approach has a higher cost per passing student (MI=$1,030/passing student vs Trad=$790/passing student). These results are discussed from perspectives of university administrators, students, and taxpayers. We consider how MI would need to adapt in order to make the benefits of active learning (particularly higher pass rates and gains on multiple measured student outcomes) available in a cost-neutral setting. This approach aims to provide a methodology to better inform decision makers balancing financial, personnel, and curricular considerations.","tags":null,"title":"Costs of success: Financial implications of implementation of active learning in introductory physics courses for students and administrators","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Justyna P.

Once in a STEM field, academic and social integration has been long thought to be important for students' persistence. Yet, it is rarely investigated. In particular, the relative impact of in-class and out-of-class interactions remains an open issue. Here, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, for students whose grades fall in the \"middle of the pack,\" the out-of-class network is the most significant predictor of persistence. To do so, we use logistic regression combined with Akaike's Information Criterion to assess in- and out-of-class networks, grades, and other factors. For students with grades at the very top (and bottom), final grade, unsurprisingly, is the best predictor of persistence -- these students are likely already committed (or simply restricted from continuing) so they persist (or drop out). For intermediate grades, though, only out-of-class closeness -- a measure of one's immersion in the network -- helps predict persistence. This does not negate the need for in-class ties. However, it suggests that, in this cohort, only students that get past the convenient in-class interactions and start forming strong bonds outside of class are or become committed to their studies. Since many students are lost through attrition, our results suggest practical routes for increasing students' persistence in STEM majors.","tags":null,"title":"Educational commitment and social networking: The power of informal networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jessica E.

MI for university physics is founded on the basis of two theoretical foundations, modelling theory of science and modelling theory of instruction.

We substantiate this claim by first describing how these theories establish complementary cycles of content development and student participation. Then we provide evidence of these interacting cycles by analysing the development of a conceptual model in a MI university physics class using video data. The video data we present includes students developing a scientific conceptual model first in a small student group and a later in the full class.

A basic tenet of science is that it is a model-driven endeavor that involves building models, then validating, deploying, and ultimately revising them in an iterative fashion. MI was developed to provide students a facsimile in the university classroom of this foundational scientific practice. As a curriculum, MI employs conceptual scientific models as the basis for the course content, and thus learning in a MI classroom involves students appropriating scientific models for their own use. Over the last ten years, substantial evidence has accumulated supporting MI's efficacy, including gains in conceptual understanding, odds of success, attitudes toward learning, self-efficacy, and social networks centered around physics learning. However, we still do not fully understand the mechanisms of how students learn physics and develop mental models of physical phenomena. Herein, we explore the hypothesis that the MI curriculum and pedagogy promotes student engagement via conceptual model building. This emphasis on conceptual model building, in turn, leads to improved knowledge organization and problem solving abilities that manifest as quantifiable functional brain changes that can be assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We conducted a neuroeducation study wherein students completed a physics reasoning task while undergoing fMRI scanning before (pre) and after (post) completing a MI introductory physics course. Preliminary results indicated that performance of the physics reasoning task was linked with increased brain activity notably in lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices that previously have been associated with attention, working memory, and problem solving, and are collectively referred to as the central executive network. Critically, assessment of changes in brain activity during the physics reasoning task from pre- versus post-instruction identified increased activity after the course notably in the posterior cingulate cortex (a brain region previously linked with episodic memory and self-referential thought) and in the frontal poles (regions linked with learning). These preliminary outcomes highlight brain regions linked with physics reasoning and, critically, suggest that brain activity during physics reasoning is modifiable by thoughtfully designed curriculum and pedagogy.","tags":["Force Concept Inventory","Mental Models","Modeling instruction","Neuroeducation","STEM learning","brain network","fMRI","physics reasoning"],"title":"Toward a Neurobiological Basis for Understanding Learning in University Modeling Instruction Physics Courses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Remy Dou","Eric Brewe","Geoff Potvin","Justyna P.

Representation use is a critical skill for learning, problem solving, and communicating in science, especially in physics where multiple representations often scaffold the understanding of a phenomenon. University Modeling Instruction, which is an active-learning, research-based introductory physics curriculum centered on students' use of scientific models, has made representation use a primary learning goal with explicit class time devoted to introducing and coordinating representations as part of the model building process. However, because of the semester break, the second semester course, Modeling Instruction-Electricity and Magnetism (MI-EM), contains a mixture of students who are returning from the Modeling Instruction-mechanics course (to whom we refer to as \"returning students\") and students who are new to Modeling Instruction with the MI-EM course (to whom we refer to as \"new students\"). In this study, we analyze the impact of MI-EM on students' representation choices across the introductory physics content for these different groups of students by examining both what individual representations students choose and their average number of representations on a modified card-sort survey with a variety of mechanics and EM questions. Using Wilcoxon-signed-rank tests, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests, Cliff's delta effect sizes, and box plots, we compare students' representation choices from pre- to postsemester, from new and returning students, and from mechanics and EM content. We find that there is a significant difference between returning and new students' representation choices, which serves as a baseline comparison between Modeling Instruction and traditional lecture-based physics classes.

All rights reserved. We describe Module Analysis for Multiple Choice Responses (MAMCR), a new methodology for carrying out network analysis on responses to multiple choice assessments. This method is used to identify modules of non-normative responses which can then be interpreted as an alternative to factor analysis. MAMCR allows us to identify conceptual modules that are present in student responses that are more specific than the broad categorization of questions that is possible with factor analysis and to incorporate non-normative responses. Thus, this method may prove to have greater utility in helping to modify instruction. In MAMCR the responses to a multiple choice assessment are first treated as a bipartite, student X response, network which is then projected into a response X response network. We then use data reduction and community detection techniques to identify modules of non-normative responses. To illustrate the utility of the method we have analyzed one cohort of postinstruction Force Concept Inventory (FCI) responses. From this analysis, we find nine modules which we then interpret. The first three modules include the following: Impetus Force, More Force Yields More Results, and Force as Competition or Undistinguished Velocity and Acceleration. This method has a variety of potential uses particularly to help classroom instructors in using multiple choice assessments as diagnostic instruments beyond the Force Concept Inventory.","tags":null,"title":"Using Module Analysis for Multiple Choice Responses: A New Method Applied to Force Concept Inventory Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Idaykis Rodriguez","Renee Michelle R.M.

We investigate the development of expert identities through the use of the sociocultural perspective of learning as participating in a community of practice. An ethnographic case study of biophysics graduate students focuses on the experiences the students have in their research group meetings. The analysis illustrates how the communities of practice-based identity constructs of competencies characterize student expert membership. A microanalysis of speech, sound, tones, and gestures in video data characterize students' social competencies in the physics community of practice. Results provide evidence that students at different stages of their individual projects have opportunities to develop social competencies such as mutual engagement, negotiability of the repertoire, and accountability to the enterprises as they interact with group members. The biophysics research group purposefully designed a learning trajectory including conducting research and writing it for publication in the larger community of practice as a pathway to expertise. The students of the research group learn to become socially competent as specific experts of their project topic and methodology, ensuring acceptance, agency, and membership in their community of practice. This work expands research on physics expertise beyond the cognitive realm and has implications for how to design graduate learning experiences to promote expert identity development.","tags":null,"title":"Developing a physics expert identity in a biophysics research group","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrienne L.

We find that women and students from statistically underrepresented ethnic groups have gains that are comparable to those of men and students from well-represented ethnic groups on this attitudinal measure, and that this result holds even when interaction effects of gender and ethnicity are included. We conclude with suggestions for future work in UMI courses and for attitudinal equity investigations generally. We encourage researchers to expand their scope beyond simple performance gaps when considering equity concerns, and to avoid relying on a single measure to evaluate student success.

We present case studies of three introductory undergraduate physics students' increasing participation in the physics learning community at FIU, which is a large, urban, Hispanic-serving institution.

High School Modeling Workshops are designed to improve high school physics teachers' understanding of physics and how to teach using the Modeling method. The basic assumption is that the teacher plays a critical role in their students' physics education. This study investigated teacher impacts on students' Force Concept Inventory scores, (FCI), with the hopes of identifying quantitative differences between teachers. This study examined student FCI scores from 18 teachers with at least a year of teaching high school physics. This data was then evaluated using a General Linear Model (GLM), which allowed for a regression equation to be fitted to the data. This regression equation was used to predict student post FCI scores, based on: Teacher ID, student pre FCI score, gender, and representation.

We discuss how self-reported student interactions can be viewed as processes of meaning making and use this to understand how quantitative measures that describe the position in a network, called centrality measures, can be understood in terms of interactions that happen in the context of a university physics course. We apply this discussion to an empirical data set of self-reported student interactions. In a weekly administered survey, first year university students enrolled in an introductory physics course at a Danish university indicated with whom they remembered having communicated within different interaction categories. For three categories pertaining to (1) communication about how to solve physics problems in the course (called the PS category), (2) communications about the nature of physics concepts (called the CD category), and (3) social interactions that are not strictly related to the content of the physics classes (called the ICS category) in the introductory mechanics course, we use the survey data to create networks of student interaction. For each of these networks, we calculate centrality measures for each student and correlate these measures with grades from the introductory course, grades from two subsequent courses, and the pretest Force Concept Inventory (FCI) scores. We find highly significant correlations (p textless 0.001) between network centrality measures and grades in all networks. We find the highest correlations between network centrality measures and future grades. In the network composed of interactions regarding problem solving (the PS network), the centrality measures hide and PageRank show the highest correlations (r=-0.32 and r=0.33, respectively) with future grades. In the CD network, the network measure target entropy shows the highest correlation (r=0.45) with future grades. In the network composed solely of noncontent related social interactions, these patterns of correlation are maintained in the sense that these network measures show the highest correlations and maintain their internal ranking. Using hierarchical linear regression, we find that a linear model that adds the network measures hide and target entropy, calculated on the ICS network, significantly improves a base model that uses only the FCI pretest scores from the beginning of the semester. Though one should not infer causality from these results, they do point to how social interactions in class are intertwined with academic interactions. We interpret this as an integral part of learning, and suggest that physics is a robust example.

Using a sequential logistic regression analysis we uncover subtle distinctions in the predictive ability of the sources of self-efficacy.

We utilize social network analysis to quantify interactions in Florida International University's Physics Learning Center (PLC) that support the development of academic and social integration. The tools of social network analysis allow us to visualize and quantify student interactions and characterize the roles of students within a social network.

Developing a sense of community among students is one of the three pillars of an overall reform effort to increase participation in physics, and the sciences more broadly, at FIU. Our implementation of a research and learning community, embedded within a course reform effort, has led to increased recruitment and retention of physics majors. Finn and Rock [1997] link the academic and social integration of students to increased rates of retention. To identify these interactions, we have initiated an investigation that utilizes social network analysis to identify primary community participants. Community interactions are then characterized through the network's density and connectivity, shedding light on learning communities and participation. Preliminary results, further research questions, and future directions utilizing social network analysis are presented. © American Institute of Physics.","tags":["Informal education","Learning community","Physics education","Social network analysis"],"title":"Investigating Student Communities with Network Analysis of Interactions in a Physics Learning Center","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric Brewe","Laird H.

The initial University of Colorado validation study included only 20% non-Caucasian student populations. In this Brief Report we extend their validation to include a predominately under-represented minority population. We validated the CLASS instrument at Florida International University, a Hispanic-serving institution, by interviewing students in introductory physics classes using a semistructured protocol, examining students' responses on the CLASS item statements, and comparing them to the items' intended meaning. We find that in our predominately Hispanic population, 94% of the students' interview responses indicate that the students interpret the CLASS items correctly, and thus the CLASS is a valid instrument. We also identify one potentially problematic item in the instrument which one third of the students interviewed consistently misinterpreted. © 2009 The American Physical Society.","tags":null,"title":"Validation study of the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey at a Hispanic-serving institution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric Brewe","Laird H.

Prospective pre-service teachers were trained and placed in six lab sections serving as undergraduate Learning Assistants (LAs) and implementing tutorial-based curriculum. LAs facilitated epistemological discussions designed to challenge and then refine student understanding of physics concepts. Students completed the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) [1], the Maryland Physics Expectation Survey (MPEX 2) [2] , and common exam questions embedded in the exams for their physics classes. We find significant differences in normalized gain on the FCI and common exam questions in favor of students in the reformed labs.
