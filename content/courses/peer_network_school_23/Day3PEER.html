<p>Day #3 continues to build on the results of Day 1, but we are actually going to analyze the network that we built in Day #1.</p>
<p>In workshop #3 we will be looking at characterizing the network as a whole, and thinking about how we can break a network up into communities.</p>
<p>The slides Day#3 can be found here:
