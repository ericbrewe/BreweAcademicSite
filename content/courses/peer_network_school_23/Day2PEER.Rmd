Day #2 is going to build on the results of yesterday, but we are actually going to analyze the network that we built in workshop #1. Also, I expect there will be a good deal more time available for discussion and questions. 

The slides for Day #2 can be found here:
```{r Day2Slides}
knitr::include_url('https://ericbrewe.com/slides/PEER_network_school_2023/PEER_Individuals_Networks.html#1')
```

We will start with the network we made with attributes. We don't need to build the nework from scratch, instead I took the network we had and stored it as a .RDS file. RDS is the native structure for R.

In workshop #2 we will be looking at centrality metrics and network properties of individual nodes. For workshop #2 to work out ok, here are the things you will need to be able to do, which we covered in workshop #1.

- Install and load the following packages:
    - tidyverse
    - tidygraph
    - ggraph
    - igraph
    - here
- Read in an R object.

Here are some readings on centrality as a set of connected metrics.


**Centrality metrics**

This one sort of spans centrality and missing data:
