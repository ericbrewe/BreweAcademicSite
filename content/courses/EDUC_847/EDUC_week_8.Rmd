**Reading Assignment**
Here is your reading assignment for Week 8

Chapter 17 of Learning Statistics with R is really well done.

**Additional Resources**
If you are struggling with R, I think that the introduction chapters of *Learning Statistics with R* are really useful, I suggest looking at chapters 3-8: https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/part-ii-an-introduction-to-r.html
