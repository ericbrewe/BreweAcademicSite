<p><strong>Reading Assignment</strong>
Here is your reading assignment for Week 1</p>
<p>Read Chapter 5 in The Effect: Research Design and Causality <a href="https://theeffectbook.net/ch-Identification.html" class="uri">https://theeffectbook.net/ch-Identification.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Additional Resources</strong>
If you are struggling with R, I think that the introduction chapters of <em>Learning Statistics with R</em> are really useful, I suggest looking at chapters 3-8: <a href="https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/part-ii-an-introduction-to-r.html" class="uri">https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/part-ii-an-introduction-to-r.html</a>
<a href="https://rstats.wtf/index.html">WTF R</a> Jenny Bryan is great at explaining things about R and so frequently, I find myself looking at her books.</p>
