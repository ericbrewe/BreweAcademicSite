<a href="https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/regression.html" class="uri">https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/regression.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Additional Resources</strong>
If you are struggling with R, I think that the introduction chapters of <em>Learning Statistics with R</em> are really useful, I suggest looking at chapters 3-8: <a href="https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/part-ii-an-introduction-to-r.html" class="uri">https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/part-ii-an-introduction-to-r.html</a></p>
