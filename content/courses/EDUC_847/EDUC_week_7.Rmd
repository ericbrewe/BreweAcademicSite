**Reading Assignment**
Here is your reading assignment for Week 7

If you want to read more about using TidyModels, here is where I have drawn much of our work from this week.

**Additional Resources**
If you are struggling with R, I think that the introduction chapters of *Learning Statistics with R* are really useful, I suggest looking at chapters 3-8: https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/part-ii-an-introduction-to-r.html
