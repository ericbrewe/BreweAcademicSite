This week you have three things to do.

First, read Chapter 23. Particularly 939-951. 

Second, complete the [activity](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x3mr9jjCdHufwgAfv1r6NTP_B2Nv9rA1C1TEWpfg1-I/edit?usp=sharing>) here. It is designed to help you think about radiated fields.

Third, complete the course evaluation form.  This is important to me, and I really am interested in your feedback.
