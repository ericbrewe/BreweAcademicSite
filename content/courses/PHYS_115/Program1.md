**Drawing magnetic field lines**

The Biot-Savart lwa for constant currents is:

$$\mathbf B = I\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi} \int \frac{\vec{dl} \times \hat{r}} {r^2} $$

In general this is an integral for every point in space around the loop of current. There are however, a few geometrical configurations that permit considerable simplification. In the case of a wire that passes perpendicular to the plane, the lines of constant magnetic field will curl around the wire according to the right hand rule (i.e. they will have no component out of the plane). You will be modeling such a system in this assignment.  Please set $\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi} = 1$  for this problem.
