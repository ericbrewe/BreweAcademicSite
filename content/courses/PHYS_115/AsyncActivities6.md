This week you have two things to do.

First, read Chapter 22. The diagrams there are very useful. 

Second, open the [PhET Simulation on Induction](<https://tinyurl.com/PhETInductionSim>). Spend 10 min playing with the simulation, make a list of as many variables as you can that determine the magnitude and direction of the induced current.

Third, work through these [three worksheets on induction](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uIyLhPfZ95gvdU_DfyulIAeC9JHOo5jbSAYSkF1DRFk/edit?usp=sharing>). They are designed to help you think about induction.
