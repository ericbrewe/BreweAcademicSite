## Course Info - Winter 2020
**Schedule**
M, W, F - 10:00-10:50
We will be meeting online, we will be using a suite of tools to manage the class and these will evolve as the course is developed. My current plan is to have Zoom based classes during the scheduled time for the first few weeks. 


6 April - 12 June (Maybe)

**Instructors**

|    | Office | email | Office Hrs |
|----|----|---|-------|------------|
| Dr. Eric Brewe | Disque Hall Rm. 918 | <eb573@drexel.edu> |
| Virgina Price | DH 916 | <vep32@drexel.edu> |

**Preamble**
This class is going to be weird. I have taught blended courses, and used the tools available, but have not had any experience with fully online classes. I will be trying, I promise to be patient with you, and will ask the same of me. 

**Learning Outcomes**
* Apply key concepts and physical laws of magnetism and circuits including conservation of charge, Coulomb’s law, electric potential, Kirchoff’s rules, Biot-Savart law, Ampere's law, Faraday’s law and Lenz’s law
* Analyze the dynamics of charged particles in magnetic fields
* Discuss sources of electric potential and analyze direct current circuits including steady state and time-varying conditions
* Develop critical thinking skills in the analysis of theory and applications in electricity and magnetism by problem solving and performing laboratory experiments

**Textbook**
Matter and Interactions, Chabay and Sherwood

**Course Tools**
Due to the transition to online learning, we will be using a variety of tools to support learning. 
*Zoom: We have a zoom classroom, you may need to install Zoom software. <https://drexel.zoom.us/my/ericbrewe> 
*Gradescope: You will be handing in homework on Gradescope, you may have gotten an email from them saying you were enrolled. We'll talk about how this will work. 
*Slack: Would it be useful to you to have a Slack channel? Or is the BBlearn site sufficient?
*PhET Simulations: These are cool simulations that do a nice job of conveying complex physics. 
*GlowScript: You will be using vPython to develop small computational projects. I think we will be using GlowScript, but I am still investigating all alternatives. 


## Course Outline
We will cover chapters 17-23 and one additional supplemental chapter S3 on Waves. Topics will include:
* Magnetic Fields
* Electric Circuits
* Magnetic Forces (including the Hall Effect)
* Patterns of EM fields (focusing on Gauss Law)
* Faraday's Law
* Electromagnetic Radiation
* Waves and Particles

## Grading
I see grades as an indicator of your understanding, so your job in earning a grade is to demonstrate your understanding of course material. 
Grades will be based on the following weighting of different course components. 

| Category             | Percentage                                                         |
| ---------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Homework:            | 30% (Combining written problem sets and computational assignments) |
| Midterm:             | 25%                                                                | 
| Final:               | 35%                                                                |
| Class Participation: | 10%                                                                |

## Homework
Since homework is one way you will demonstrate understanding, you will need to write up homework in a way that demonstrates that you understand the material. You will need to not only show your work, but incorporate explanations of how and why you are doing what you are doing. 

### Written Assignments
Homework will be due at the beginning of class each week on Friday, except during Week 1 and the week of the midterm. 

You are allowed to work together on homework in the analysis phase, but you will need to work individually in the 'writing it up' phase.  This means while you may come to the same answers, your explanations of how you got there will be unique and distinct. 

### Programming Assignments

Programming assignments will be discussed in recitation, and will count as 1/3 of your total homework grade. Programming assignments are due at the beginning of recitation on Wednesday in weeks 3, 5, 8, and 10 (see schedule below).

## Exams

There will be one midterm exam during Week TBD. 

There will be a final exam given during the final exam period, it will indclude material from the entire course.
