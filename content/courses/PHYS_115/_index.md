## Course Info - Winter 2020
**Schedule**
M, W, F - 10:00-10:50

30 March - 12 June

**Instructors**

|    | Office | email | Office Hrs |
|----|----|---|-------|------------|
| Dr. Eric Brewe | Disque Hall Rm. 918 | <eb573@drexel.edu> |
| Virgina Price | DH 916 | <vep32@drexel.edu> |

**Learning Outcomes**
* Apply key concepts and physical laws of magnetism and circuits including conservation of charge, Coulomb’s law, electric potential, Kirchoff’s rules, Biot-Savart law, Ampere's law, Faraday’s law and Lenz’s law
* Analyze the dynamics of charged particles in magnetic fields
* Discuss sources of electric potential and analyze direct current circuits including steady state and time-varying conditions
* Develop critical thinking skills in the analysis of theory and applications in electricity and magnetism by problem solving and performing laboratory experiments

**Textbook**
Matter and Interactions, Chabay and Sherwood




## Course Outline
We will cover chapters 17-23 and one additional supplemental chapter S3 on Waves. Topics will include:
* Magnetic Fields
* Electric Circuits
* Magnetic Forces (including the Hall Effect)
* Patterns of EM fields (focusing on Gauss Law)
* Faraday's Law
* Electromagnetic Radiation
* Waves and Particles

## Grading
I see grades as an indicator of your understanding, so your job in earning a grade is to demonstrate your understanding of course material. 
Grades will be based on the following weighting of different course components. 

| Category             | Percentage                                                         |
| ---------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Homework:            | 30% (Combining written problem sets and computational assignments) |
| Midterm:             | 25%                                                                | 
| Final:               | 35%                                                                |
| Class Participation: | 10%                                                                |

## Homework

Homework will be dur at the beginning of class each week on Friday, except during Week 1 and the week of the midterm. Since homework is one way you will demonstrate understanding, you will need to write up homework in a way that demonstrates that you understand the material. You will need to not only show your work, but incorporate explanations of how and why you are doing what you are doing. 

You are allowed to work together on homework in the analysis phase, but you will need to work individually in the 'writing it up' phase.  This means while you may come to the same answers, your explanations of how you got there will be unique and distinct. 

### Programming Assingments

Programming assignments will be discussed in recitation, and will count as 1/3 of your total homework grade. Programming assignments are due at the beginning of recitation on Wednesday in weeks 3, 5, 8, and 10 (see schedule below).

## Exams

There will be one midterm exam during Week TBD. 

There will be a final exam given during the final exam period, it will indclude material from the entire course.
