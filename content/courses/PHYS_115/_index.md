## Course Info - Winter 2020
**Schedule**
M, W, F - 10:00-10:50 + Recitation W 2:00-3:50 or 4:00-5:50
We will be mixing synchronous and asynchronous class meetings. 

Mondays will be synchronous Problem Solving Workshops, Wednesdays will be synchronous New Material, Fridays will be asynchronous activities. All synchronous activities will be recorded and posted in a separate section.

6 April - 12 June

**Preamble**
This class is going to be weird, times are weird. I have taught blended courses, and used the tools available, but have not had any experience with fully online classes. I will be trying, I promise to be patient with you, and will ask the same of me. 

**Learning Outcomes**
* Apply key concepts and physical laws of magnetism and circuits including conservation of charge, Coulomb’s law, electric potential, Kirchoff’s rules, Biot-Savart law, Ampere's law, Faraday’s law and Lenz’s law
* Analyze the dynamics of charged particles in magnetic fields
* Discuss sources of electric potential and analyze direct current circuits including steady state and time-varying conditions
* Develop critical thinking skills in the analysis of theory and applications in electricity and magnetism by problem solving and performing laboratory experiments

**Textbook**
Matter and Interactions, Chabay and Sherwood

**Course Tools**
Due to the transition to online learning, we will be using a variety of tools to support learning. 

*Zoom*: We have a zoom classroom, you may need to install Zoom software. You should have received an invitation. 

*Gradescope*: You will be handing in homework on Gradescope, you should have gotten an email from them about enrollment. We'll talk about how this will work. 

*Slack*: We are going to have a Slack channel that people can use for varied classroom communications, you are not required to sign up, but, I've used it before, and students found it to be pretty useful. 

*GlowScript*: The class will be using GlowScript <https://www.glowscript.org/> to develop small computational projects. GlowScript is not quite the same as vPython - but very clase, the TA, Virginia Price will be holding recitations on Wednesdays. 


## Course Outline
We will aim to cover chapters 17-23 and one additional supplemental chapter S3 on Waves. Topics will include:
* Magnetic Fields
* Electric Circuits
* Magnetic Forces (including the Hall Effect)
* Patterns of EM fields (focusing on Gauss Law)
* Faraday's Law
* Electromagnetic Radiation
* Waves and Particles

## Grading
I see grades as an indicator of your understanding, so your job in earning a grade is to demonstrate your understanding of course material. Because this course is using a different format, we are going to emphasize using problem solutions rather than exams as a way of demonstrating your competencies. 

| Category             | Percentage                                                         |
| ---------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Written Homework:            | 65%        |
| Computational Homework:    | 25%  | 
| Class Participation: | 10%        |

## Homework
Since homework is the primary way you will demonstrate understanding, you will need to write up homework in a way that demonstrates that you understand the material. You will need to not only show your work, but incorporate explanations of how and why you are doing what you are doing. In order to give you maximum opportunity to demonstrate your understanding, you will be allowed to re-submit your assignment for regrading. There are two types of homework, written assignments and computational assignments.  

### Written Assignments
Homework will be submitted through Gradescope, and will be due on Monday nights at 11:59 PM. 

You are allowed to work together on homework in the analysis phase, but you will need to work individually in the 'writing it up' phase.  This means while you may come to the same answers, your explanations of how you got there will be unique and distinct. 

The goal of this class is that you master the content. We will grade each problem on each assignment with a four point rubric. If your score on any given problem is a 3 or 4, you will have completed the problem at a satisfactory level. If you do not score a 3 or a 4 you are welcome to resubmit. We will accept resubmissions each week on Monday nights. 

Your score on the written assignments will be the proportion of the problems that you have completed at the satisfactory level. So if you do all the problems, but only reach satisfactory on 85\% of them, you will get an 85\% for the homework score. 

### Programming Assignments

Programming assignments will also be submitted through Gradescope. These assignments will be discussed in recitation, and will count as 25\% of your overall grade. Programming assignments are due at the beginning of recitation on Wednesday in weeks 3, 5, 7, and 9 (see schedule below).

## Class Participation

Much of this class will be active, we will expect you to be working together on problems, computational assignments, discussing, and asking questions. This will be worth 10\% of your overall grade.

## Grades
Grades for the course will be assigned according to the following scale:

| Grade | Percentage|
|-------|-----------|
|A+ | 97-100|
|A | 90 - 96|
|B+ | 87-89|
|B | 80-86|
|C+| 77-79 |
|C | 70-76 |
|D+ | 67-69 |
|D | 60-66 |
|F | 0-59 |

## Drexel University Resources: 
Note that Drexel University offers several resources to students in need.  These include but are not limited to:

* [The Physics Help Center](https://drexel.edu/coas/academics/departments-centers/physics/physics-help-center/) offers free tutoring sessions to Drexel students in introductory physics classes. It is not totally clear to me how this will work during Spring 2020.

* [Office of Disability Resources (ODR).](http://drexel.edu/oed/disabilityResources/students/) Students with disabilities requesting accommodations and services at Drexel University need to present a current Accommodation Verification Letter (AVL) to the instructor before any accommodation can be made. AVLs are issued by ODR.

* Health Center and Student Counseling: Please visit the
following websites for specific information:
    * <http://drexel.edu/counselingandhealth/student-health-center/overview/>
    * <http://drexel.edu/counselingandhealth/counseling-center/overview/>

* Academic Integrity: Breaches of academic integrity, for example by cheating or plagiarizing, are serious infractions of the community standards of Drexel University. Refer to the following websites to understand expectations of students and consequences for violating these standards: 
    * [Academic Integrity Policy](http://drexel.edu/provost/policies/academic-integrity/)
    * [Student Code of Conduct](http://drexel.edu/studentlife/community_standards/studentHandbook/)

* Registration Policies:
