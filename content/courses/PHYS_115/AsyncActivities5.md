This week you have two things to do.

First, read Chapter 21. 

I have not hidden that I don't love Gauss Law or Ampere's Law. 

Your challenge for the second part is to find an application of  Gauss or Ampere's Law that you find interesting. Then send me an email about it - can be written or a video, I don't care.
