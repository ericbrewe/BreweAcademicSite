This week I want to ask for two things.

First, complete the course evaluation form.  This is important to me, and I really am interested in your feedback. 

Second, work on completing assignments that you have missed, and resubmitting any that are not up to satisfactory standards. All assignments will be due on June 12, which is the last day of finals.
