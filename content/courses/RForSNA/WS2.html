<p>If you missed it, <a href="https://drexel.zoom.us/rec/share/99dVH-Guy09Jf7OV12PBAql6HJr6aaa81HUWqfUKyBn6z3EdwCdgLwjRhs_8OX9V">here is video of Workshop #2</a>.</p>
<p>Workshop #2 is going to build on the results of WS1, but we are actually going to analyze the network that we built in workshop #1. Also, I expect there will be a good deal more time available for discussion and questions. We will start with the network we made with attributes. We don’t need to build the nework from scratch, instead I took the network we had and stored it as a .RDS file. RDS is the native structure for R.</p>
<p>In workshop #2 we will be looking at centrality metrics and network properties of individual nodes. For workshop #2 to work out ok, here are the things you will need to be able to do, which we covered in workshop #1.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install and load the following packages:
<ul>
<li>tidyverse</li>
<li>tidygraph</li>
<li>ggraph</li>
<li>igraph</li>
<li>here</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read in an R object.</li>
</ul>
<p>In case you are interested, here are a few resources that I found useful for doing

<div id="journals" class="section level2">
<h2>Journals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Network Science - Cambridge Press Journal focused on Network Science - much more graph theoretic</li>
<li>Connections - The journal of INSNA - much more focused on social network analysis &amp; applications.</li>
<li>Social Networks - An Elsevier Journal focused on SNA - much more statistical</li>
