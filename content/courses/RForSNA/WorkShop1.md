In order to prepare for workshop one - I have five things that I need you to do:

1. Install R and RStudio on your computer. 

    a. R can be downloaded from a link on this website <https://www.r-project.org/>
    b. RStudio can be downloaded here: <https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>
    
2. Set up a series of folders somewhere:

    a. The toplevel folder should be called "RForSNA"
    b. Inside there should be folders called "data" and "plots"
    
3. I will send you a survey on Survey Monkey.  I need you to answer the survey
4. Before the first workshop, I will email you a few csv files, please download each and save in the folder titled "data"
5. Let me know if you have trouble with any of the steps 1-4.
