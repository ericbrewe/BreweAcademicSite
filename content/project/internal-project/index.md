Modeling Instruction (MI) was first developed for the use in high school classrooms at Arizona State University and has since been implemented at the undergraduate level. MI is built on the idea that building, validating, deploying, and ultimately revising models is the central practice in science. Accordingly, the idea behind MI is to have students learn by building, validating, deploying and revising models. The curriculum and pedagogy are designed to be student centered where students build models by engaging in discussion, problem solving, and experimentation. Conceptual models are purposeful coordinated sets of representations (e.g., graphs, equations, diagrams, or written descriptions) of a particular class of phenomena that exist in the shared social domain of discourse. What this means is we focus on having students analyze phenomena by creating representations that allow them to predict and explain.  In classes, students explore phenomena through experimentation or simulation, they make small whiteboards that summarize their work and then they share these in board meetings.  The instructor acts as a facilitator and guide.
