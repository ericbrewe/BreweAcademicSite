abstract: The dilemma of what to teach today is pervasive and in many ways hotly debated. Answering this question gets at the core purposes of university education. Amid a background of challenges to higher education, it is easy to feel overwhelmed and helpless. However, a number of principles remain true. Students learn effectively when they are active participants in their learning. As a result, the instructor's dilemma of what to teach needs to be answered in concert with how to teach it. In this talk, we will consider evidence of the need for active learning and also take the opportunity to actively engage for learning.
